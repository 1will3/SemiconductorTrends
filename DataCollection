Step 1: Data Collection from arXiv
Objective: Use arXiv’s API to gather abstracts and metadata for research papers related to
semiconductors in the chemistry field.
● Tasks:
○ Use the arXiv API to query papers with keywords like "semiconductors" and
"chemistry."
○ Retrieve the metadata for each paper, including title, abstract, publication date,
and categories.
○ Store the collected data in a structured format (e.g., CSV or Pandas DataFrame)
for analysis.
Example API Query:
http://export.arxiv.org/api/query?search_query=all:semiconductors+chem
istry&start=0&max_results=1000
●●
Deliverables:
○ A dataset containing paper titles, abstracts, authors, categories, and publication
dates.
● Related Packages:
○ Requests, beautifulSoup: For making API calls to arXiv.
○ pandas: For storing and manipulating the collected data.
